### Requirements

- First you will need to install [Foundry](https://book.getfoundry.sh/getting-started/installation).
NOTE: If you are on a windows machine it is recommended to use [WSL](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install)
- Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/)

### Set your environment Variables

Use the `.env.example` template to create a `.env` file and store the environement variables. You will need to populate the `RPC_URL` for the desired network(s). RPC url can be obtained from various providers, including [Ankr](https://www.ankr.com/rpc/) (no sign-up required) and [Infura](https://infura.io/).

Use .env file

1. Make a copy of `.env.example`

     NOTE: If you set up a global environment variable, that will take precedence.
